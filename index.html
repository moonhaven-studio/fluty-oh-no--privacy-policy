  <h1>Privacy Policy — Fluty Oh No!</h1>
  <p class="muted"><strong>Last updated:</strong> February 16, 2026</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Moonhaven Studio</strong> (“we,” “us,” or “our”) handles data
    related to your use of the <strong>Fluty Oh No!</strong> mobile game (the “App”).
  </p>

  <h2>1. Scope</h2>
  <p>
    The App is a casual arcade game. We do not require account creation and we do not ask users to provide
    their name, email address, phone number, or physical address to play.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data we may collect</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on which integrations are enabled (e.g., ads, analytics, crash reporting), we may process:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Usage and diagnostics data</strong>: in-app events (e.g., screens viewed, session duration), error logs, performance and stability data.</li>
    <li><strong>Device/technical identifiers</strong>: technical identifiers (e.g., Android Advertising ID where applicable), device model, OS version, language, time zone, IP address, and app installation identifiers.</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising data</strong> (if ads are enabled): information needed to serve, cap frequency, and measure ad performance (including the Advertising ID where applicable).</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="muted">
    <strong>Note:</strong> If you do not use ads/analytics/crash reporting SDKs, remove the relevant items above and keep only a “we do not collect data” statement.
  </p>

  <h2>3. How we use data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To operate the App and maintain stability (bug fixes, performance improvements).</li>
    <li>To understand aggregated App usage (metrics and analytics) and improve the experience.</li>
    <li>To display and measure ads (only if the App is monetized with ads).</li>
    <li>To prevent fraud/abuse and protect the security of the App.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Sharing with third parties</h2>
  <p>
    We may share strictly necessary data with <strong>service providers</strong> that operate on our behalf,
    such as providers of:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Advertising</strong> (e.g., Google AdMob, Unity Ads) — if enabled.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics</strong> (e.g., Firebase Analytics, Unity Analytics) — if enabled.</li>
    <li><strong>Crash reporting</strong> (e.g., Firebase Crashlytics) — if enabled.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These providers may process data under their own policies and configurations, and only for the purpose
    of providing the service (ads, analytics, and stability).
  </p>

  <h2>5. Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App <strong>is</strong> directed to children under 13.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If <strong>it is</strong> directed to children: we avoid collecting personal data and configure ads/SDKs according to applicable policies (e.g., restrictions for child-directed apps).</li>
    <li>If <strong>it is not</strong>: we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information, contact us and we will take appropriate steps to remove it.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain data for as long as necessary to operate the App and fulfill the purposes described above
    (e.g., diagnostics and analytics), subject to technical and legal requirements. Aggregated data may be
    retained longer.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use reasonable security measures to protect data. However, no method of transmission or storage is
    100% secure.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Your rights</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on your location and applicable law, you may have rights to request access, correction,
    deletion, restriction, or information about how data is processed and shared.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Contact</h2>
  <p>
    If you have questions or requests about privacy:
    <br />
    <strong>Email:</strong> hello.moonhaven@gmail.com
    <br />
    <strong>Developer:</strong> Moonhaven Studio
  </p>

  <h2>10. Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make material changes, we will update the
    “Last updated” date above.
